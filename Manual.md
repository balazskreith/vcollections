# Developers Manual

This manual is written to help you to understand Virtualized Collections 
in general, and develop your applications with it. 
First the architecture of the vcollections is detailed, which 
helps understanding the the basic concept and the modularity of the library.
Then collections are listed with examples how to instantiate them. 
Storages are detailed to see how we can virtualize the underlying 
persistent space for the collections further. 
To make the usage easier Builders are introduced and they are detailed here.
Finally two predefined modules for two popular NoSQLstorages are detailed 
to use it with vcollections.
